========
92.2 LTS
========

The Avocado team is proud to present a minor release in the 92.0 LTS
(Long Term Stability) series, version 92.2 LTS, is now available!

LTS Release
===========

For more information on what a LTS release means, please read
:ref:`rfc-long-term-stability`.

Upgrading from 92.1 to 92.2
===========================

Upgrading should be smooth, and there are no additional instructions
besides the steps on the installation method used.  For instance,
if using pip, it should be as simple as::

  $ pip install avocado-framework==92.2

To use the latest 92.x release, you can also always do::

  $ pip install avocado-framework<93.0

Changes since 92.1
==================

* Support for Python 3.12 by using :mod:`importlib` instead of
  :mod:`imp`

* Support for z16 on s390x in :mod:`avocado.utils.cpu`.

* Fixes for building the documentation

* Updates to the :mod:`avocaod.utils.vmimage` libraries to make it
  work with current providers and repos.

* Many fixes to the CI jobs.
