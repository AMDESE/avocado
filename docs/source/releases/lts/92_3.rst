========
92.3 LTS
========

The Avocado team is proud to present a minor release in the 92.0 LTS
(Long Term Stability) series, version 92.3 LTS, is now available!

LTS Release
===========

For more information on what a LTS release means, please read
:ref:`rfc-long-term-stability`.

Upgrading from 92.2 to 92.3
===========================

Upgrading should be smooth, and there are no additional instructions
besides the steps on the installation method used.  For instance,
if using pip, it should be as simple as::

  $ pip install avocado-framework==92.3

To use the latest 92.x release, you can also always do::

  $ pip install avocado-framework<93.0

Changes since 92.2
==================

* Make it possible to run under Python 3.13, by replacing the use of
  the depreated :func:`logging.warn` with :func:`logging.warning`.

* Many fixes to the CI jobs.
