.. _lts_92_0:

========
92.1 LTS
========

The Avocado team is proud to present a minor release in the 92.0 LTS
(Long Term Stability) series, version 92.1 LTS, is now available!

LTS Release
===========

For more information on what a LTS release means, please read
:ref:`rfc-long-term-stability`.

Upgrading from 92.0 to 92.1
===========================

Upgrading should be smooth, and there are no additional instructions
besides the steps on the installation method used.  For instance,
if using pip, it should be as simple as::

  $ pip install avocado-framework==92.1

To use the latest 92.x release, you can also always do::

  $ pip install avocado-framework<93.0

Changes since 92.0
==================

* Third-party libraries log messages are no longer being saved on a
  test's "debug.log"

* The independence of the status server "uri" and "listen"
  configurations was not being respected, making a configuration with
  different addresses impossible, and that is now fixed.

* The "--show" option is now working as expected, allowing users to
  specify custom loggers to be shown on the UI.

* Many fixes to the CI jobs.
